# Schooling Globers Video Link Archive

## Up-to-Date Link Archive of Austin Witsit's 'Schooling Globers' Videos

Austin Witsit's video content appears to be intentionally downranked by the algorithm. Since these videos are of high value to the flat earth community, this repo makes an effort to track them, but more importantly, to link to the timestamps where specific questions are answered or specific proofs are given on particular topics.

If you are not familiar with github, please contribute youtube links / timestamps in the [issues](https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/schooling_globers_archive/issues) tab above, and I will add them to the archive. 

For those unfamiliar with the trick of accessing indexed content more precisely, search engines generally acknowledge this directive in their search bar:

site:<site> <search term>

**site:youtube** schooling globers

This is a good way to find algorithmically burried content.
