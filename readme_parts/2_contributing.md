### CONTRIBUTING

This repository aims to be a comprehensive question and answer log, consisting of:

`<question> <timestamped_youtube_link>`

in the comments below.

These videos are extensive, and many of you have watched them and are aware of where important questions are answered. We greatly appreciate any contributions that help log these questions and answers. You can contribute either on the Reddit post or on GitHub as outlined below:

### [GitHub](https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/schooling_globers_archive)

If you're not familiar with GitHub, please contribute YouTube links/timestamps in the [issues](https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/schooling_globers_archive/issues) tab above, and I will add them to the archive. Otherwise, feel free to clone the repository and modify the list directly.

For those unfamiliar with the trick of accessing indexed content more precisely, search engines like Bing and Google generally acknowledge this directive in their search bar:

`site:youtube schooling globers`

This method helps find algorithmically buried content more effectively.

## Thank you for your contributions!

Note: Depending on the interest, I will create a more user friendly archive since answer questions, since referencing past answers is a very important part of progressing in True Earth cosmology.
